## The above worked only after setting the Windows 10 System Environment Variable JAVA_HOME to the 64-bit address which was missing before
Step 1: Install the latest JRE for the 64 bit version of Windows OS if that's what you have
Step 2: set variable "JAVA_HOME"" to C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_60
